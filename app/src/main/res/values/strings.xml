    It is a fresh and offbeat concept - where the participants need to write and compile their program with the monitor screens switched off. The event will span over 2 hours.
    The details are as follows:\n\n\nThe participants will be given 3 problems of varying difficulty levels.
    \n\nThe first problem will be a warm up question. The participants will be provided a syntactically incorrect code written on paper. The participants will be required to identify the errors and type other two questions will be problem statements based on basic programming concepts.
    \n\nEach team will be allowed one free “Screen time” (where the monitor screen can be turned on for 60 seconds), after which they will be penalised with 3 points for each extra screen time.
    \n\nEach team can avail a maximum of 5 screen times.
    \n\nAt a time only 5 teams will be allowed to avail the facility of Screen Time, the slots for which will be allotted on a first come first serve basis.

        Code in Less is an onsite competitive programming contest where the participants don’t just need to solve the problems but write their code using the minimum number of characters. Solve the problems, optimize your code and shorten it. The shortest solution wins it all!

        Do you think you have what it takes to be a great coder? You know a language in and out? This time it is not only about getting the logic and algorithms right but also to code it correct knowing the ifs and buts of the programming language.
        \n\nSo make teams of two and be here to prove your skills. Teams can be cross-school and cross-college. Lone wolves are also allowed. First round will be pen-paper based and you have to opt in either for C++ or Java. Second round will be computer based and in Python3. You will be allowed to interpret the code only twice during the whole round. No IDE or internet connection will be provided. Minimum time and least number of changes will be the criteria for judging along with the fully functional code.
        \n\nNow get ready to start debugging and brag by finding the bugs hiding in the covers of the seemingly well-knit code.

        It\'s not just a regular contest challenging your problem-solving skills. It\'s SWITCHEROO. It’s a contest testing your abilities to work as a team. The competition not only examines your skills as to how well you coordinate with your partner but also how analytical you are in an isolated and tensed situation.

        The event Euler Games invites maths and computer science enthusiasts to participate in “The Euler’s Islands” - a fusion of Euler Games questions and Forbidden Island(Board Game).
        \n\nFind effective solutions of some interesting problems and win the game. The Game is setup on the islands. The islands will be based on math concepts that appear frequently in project Euler problems, say prime island for prime no. based questions.
        \n\nTo attempt the maximum no. of question from a certain island the team of 1 to 3 people will have to make decisions that ensures that the island does not sink. Team with max points wins. For a particular team questions end either when the time is up or when all islands sink.
        \n\nThe problems difficulty level increases gradually so teams have to use Maths and Computer Science skills together to trace the distance.
